This project is trying to solve mobile localization through WiFi access point signals.

Given a set of known access point locations, standard particle filter techniques can be used to localize a user. Labeling this large data set is prohibitively expensive and boring.

This project is investigating what can be accomplished by labeling minimal data and solving access point locations though dimensionality reduction and constraint satisfaction techniques.
